# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Assignment
Started off with code and used activities from class to get to a certain point.
From there I needed assistance of AI and the recorded videos of office hours to finish getting the code to do what I wanted.
It was a challenge but I certainly feel more confident with VBA.
